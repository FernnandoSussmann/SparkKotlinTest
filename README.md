# SparkKotlinTest
Test/try java spark library on Kotlin.

## Why?
I wish to see if spark libraries work well in Kotlin, they were supposed to as one of the main features of kotlin is it compatibility with Java. So I will write some sample code and list my impressions so far.

### Impressions
#### The good ones
- Everything I tested so far works.
- Less verbose than equivalent Java code.
- Seems easy to translate Java and Scala examples into Kotlin code. (There is a possibility that my opinion about the Scala is biased because I have worked with this language before)


#### The bad ones
- Intellij does not recognize the correct arguments to select method. It's not a problem of the language because it runs correctly, but it annoys me.

#### Conclusion
- Appears to be a good JVM alternative, but I think it should be tested with real cases examples.

## How to run
Using Intellij open the main file on ```src/main/kotlin``` and click on the play button on the main function.
